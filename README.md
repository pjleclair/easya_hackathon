# Prediction Marketplace Project

This project is a prediction marketplace featuring overcollateralized tokenization, built using Next.js and Stacks.js to interact with Clarity smart contracts hosted on the Hiro platform. The integration of Stacks.js allowed us to unlock the potential of BTC and leverage the security of the Bitcoin blockchain. Without Stacks, we would not have been able to tap into the trillions in Bitcoin liquidity.

## Key Technologies and Features

### Stacks and Clarity
- **Secure, Bitcoin-backed Platform**: Utilizes the security of Bitcoin to deploy decentralized finance (DeFi) contracts.
- **Transparency and Predictability**: Clarity smart contracts ensure transparent and predictable financial transactions.

### SIP-010 Compliant bUSD Token
- **Stable USD-pegged Asset**: Users can mint and burn bUSD in exchange for staked collateral.
- **SIP-010 Compliance**: Ensures compatibility across Stacks applications.

### Oracle
- **Real-time BTC Price Data**: Provides accurate collateral management and token minting based on up-to-date prices.

### Clarinet
- **Simplified Local Development**: Facilitates rapid testing and iteration of contract logic before deployment.

### Stacks Sandbox on Testnet
- **Realistic, End-to-end Testing**: Simulates mainnet conditions to verify contract security and functionality.

## Benefits of Stacks.js
- **Easy Wallet Integration**: Simplifies the process of connecting to a wallet and calling contract functions.
- **Focus on Product Ideation and UX**: The ease of developer experience allowed us to concentrate on creating a high-quality user experience.
